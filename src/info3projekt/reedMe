Info project f√ºr Info 3
von gruppe 6

How to Start the game.
Go into the Main.java file and run the program.
you can choose between two levels.
Level 1 is a simple linear level and represents a train.
Level 2 is more complex with one branching path and represents the HTW WH building c and the cafeteria.

Note:
All classes should be in the package info3projekt.
all classes gotten comments and some got also whats bad about some of they code. :D
And creating text on code you allready have is not the best idea since i dont know what we could test here.
And what classes are should be tested.

Test are in the test folder.

Spoiler!!!!:

the solutions of the puzzles are in the Puzzles are in the text file solutions.txt
expect for normal puzzels that are created with random math from us but they are simple like "+" "-" "*"
